## 💻 Initializing...

Every great journey begins with a single line of code. This is **Nick's** archive for engineering excellence.

### `const aboutMe =`
I am a Front-End Developer currently focused on the AIoT sector. My primary mission is to bridge the gap between complex data and intuitive user interfaces.

```typescript
interface Developer {
  name: string;
  role: string;
  stack: string[];
  goal: string;
}

const nick: Developer = {
  name: "Myunggeun Kang (Nick)",
  role: "Front-End Engineer",
  stack: ["Angular", "RxJS", "TypeScript", "D3.js"],
  goal: "To become an irreplaceable T-shaped engineer."
};
